Versi terbaru: **v2.0.5** · [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/robyajo/laravel-security-monitor) · [Repositori GitHub](https://github.com/robyajo/laravel-security-monitor)

All notable changes to `robyajo/laravel-security-monitor` will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- **Kompatibilitas CI & Test Matrix L10 - L13**:
  - Menambahkan dependensi `guzzlehttp/guzzle: ^7.8|^8.0` pada `composer.json` untuk menjamin ketersediaan PSR-7 Response saat pengujian `Http::fake()` dan fitur `VersionCheckService` pada lingkungan Laravel 10.
  - Memperbaiki analisis statis PHPStan pada evaluasi tipe dinamis `LoginThrottleService` dan `SecurityInstallCommand`.
  - Mengoptimalkan assertion command options pada `SecurityInstallAutoInjectTest`.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Pemeriksaan Versi Otomatis & Notifikasi Upgrade di Terminal (`php artisan serve` & `composer run dev`)**:
  - Secara otomatis memeriksa apakah terdapat versi rilis terbaru di Packagist/GitHub saat pengembang menjalankan `php artisan serve` atau `composer run dev` (`artisan dev`).
  - Menampilkan notifikasi visual di terminal konsol yang elegan dan informatif jika versi baru telah dirilis, lengkap dengan saran perintah upgrade.
  - Pemeriksaan dirancang sangat ringan, non-blocking (timeout 2 detik), dan di-cache selama 1 jam (`SECURITY_VERSION_CHECK_CACHE_TTL=3600`) sehingga tidak pernah memperlambat atau mengganggu startup server.
  - Dapat diaktifkan/dinonaktifkan melalui konfigurasi `security.version_check.enabled` atau variabel `.env`: `SECURITY_VERSION_CHECK_ENABLED=true`.

- **Perintah Baru `php artisan security:upgrade`**:
  - Perintah artisan terpadu untuk memeriksa, memperbarui, dan menyinkronkan seluruh komponen package:
    - `php artisan security:upgrade`: Memperbarui package via Composer (`composer update robyajo/laravel-security-monitor`), menerapkan migrasi database terbaru (`php artisan migrate`), menyinkronkan rute kustom (`routes/security.php` & `routes/security-api.php`), menyinkronkan tampilan dashboard monitoring (Blade/Livewire & React/TSX), serta membersihkan cache framework.
    - Opsi `--check`: Hanya memeriksa status versi tanpa menjalankan proses pembaruan.
    - Opsi `--force`: Memaksa pembaruan dan sinkronisasi aset meskipun sudah di versi terbaru.
    - Opsi `--no-composer`: Melewati pembaruan Composer (hanya sinkronisasi aset lokal).
    - Opsi `--no-migrate`: Melewati eksekusi migrasi database.
    - Opsi `--sync-routes` & `--sync-views`: Memaksa pembaruan berkas rute dan tampilan dashboard.

- **Integrasi Informasi Versi pada Dashboard Pengaturan & REST API**:
  - Halaman Pengaturan Keamanan (`/security/settings`) pada Livewire dan React kini menampilkan status versi aktif dan banner notifikasi pembaruan secara visual.
  - Endpoint REST API `GET /api/security/settings` menyertakan metadata `version` (`current`, `latest`, `update_available`).

## [2.0.7] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Interactive Security Settings Page & Dynamic Configuration (Livewire, React, & REST API)**:
  - Added dedicated Security Settings dashboard page accessible via `/security/settings` in both Livewire (`pages/security/settings.blade.php`) and React (`pages/security/settings.tsx`).
  - Added Settings link (⚙️) to the sidebar navigation in both Blade and React dashboard layouts.
  - Interactive radio cards allowing administrators to configure blocking scope with clear visual guidance:
    - **Isolasi Perangkat Saja (`device`)** *(Default / Rekomendasi)*: Only quarantines the offending device based on Device ID / Fingerprint / LAN IP, keeping innocent users sharing the same WiFi or NAT router completely safe.
    - **Seluruh IP Router Publik (`ip`)**: Quarantines the entire public router IP address.
  - Dynamic configuration controls for:
    - Automatic blocking scope (`auto_block_scope`: `device` or `ip`)
    - Zero tolerance instant blocking scope (`instant_block_scope`: `device` or `ip`)
    - Threshold count (`auto_block_threshold`)
    - Accumulation window in minutes (`auto_block_window`)
    - Quarantine duration in hours (`auto_block_duration`)
    - Zero tolerance instant duration (`instant_block_duration`)
    - HTTP 403 block enforcement master toggle (`block_enforcement`)
  - Dynamic multi-layer persistence: `SecuritySetting` database model/migration, high-performance in-memory and Cache layer, with automatic `.env` synchronization.
  - Headless REST API endpoints:
    - `GET /api/security/settings` (retrieves current configuration)
    - `POST /api/security/settings` (updates and applies settings with zero downtime)
  - Added comprehensive feature tests in `tests/Feature/SecuritySettingsTest.php`.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Device-Scoped Automatic & Instant Blocking (WiFi & NAT Router Isolation)**:
  - Enforced device-level isolation for both threshold-based automatic blocking (`autoBlockIfNeeded`) and zero-tolerance instant blocking (`blockImmediately`), ensuring that only the specific attacking device is quarantined rather than blocking the entire public router IP or office/cafe WiFi network.
  - Innocent users and colleagues sharing the same NAT public IP address can continue accessing the application without being affected or receiving HTTP 403 Forbidden.
  - Added configurable blocking scopes in `config/security.php` and `stubs/env.stub`:
    - `SECURITY_AUTO_BLOCK_SCOPE=device` (options: `device` or `ip`, default: `device`).
    - `SECURITY_INSTANT_BLOCK_SCOPE=device` (options: `device` or `ip`, default: `device`).
  - Deterministic client device fingerprinting (`generateDeviceFingerprint()`): automatically synthesizes client identifiers (`dev_*`) from User-Agent, language, and client platform hints when custom headers (`X-Device-Id`, `X-Client-Id`) are not explicitly sent.
  - Persistent device cookie attachment: `BlockIpAddress` middleware attaches an `app_device_id` cookie to responses (including 403 Forbidden response pages) to guarantee seamless device tracking across subsequent visits.
  - Updated `LogFailedLoginAttempt` and `LoginThrottleService` to track and pass device IDs and private LAN IPs discovered via WebRTC to brute-force lockout evaluations.
  - Added end-to-end feature tests in `tests/Feature/DeviceLevelBlockingTest.php` verifying that two clients on the identical public router IP (`REMOTE_ADDR`) are isolated so that the attacker receives 403 Forbidden while the innocent device receives 200 OK.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Automated API Setup & Customizable Route Files (`routes/security.php` & `routes/security-api.php`)**:
  - Automatically checks and executes `php artisan install:api` during `security:install` if API routes are not yet initialized in Laravel 11/12/13 host applications.
  - Generates `routes/security-api.php` for headless REST API endpoints and wires it into `routes/api.php` (`require __DIR__.'/security-api.php';`).
  - Generates `routes/security.php` for web dashboard routes and wires it into `routes/web.php` (`require __DIR__.'/security.php';`).
  - Web routes in `routes/security.php` render directly to views (`pages::security.*` / `resources/views/pages/security/*` for Livewire/Blade or Inertia controllers for React) so developers have full control to customize URL prefixes, middleware, layout wrappers, and custom pages.
  - Added `security-routes`, `security-routes-web`, and `security-routes-api` publication tags to `php artisan vendor:publish`.
  - Added `--without-routes` and `--without-api` flags to `php artisan security:install`.
  - Smart route loading in `SecurityMonitorServiceProvider`: prioritized host route files if customized and prevents route duplication with host `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Pure Vanilla CSS Architecture for Dashboard Views**:
  - Migrated both Blade (Livewire) and React (TSX) dashboard stubs to pure Vanilla CSS.
  - Eliminated external UI library dependencies (removed Livewire Flux UI, Shadcn UI, `@/lib/utils`, and `sonner`).
  - Added standalone `security.css` stylesheet and zero-dependency `ui.tsx` helper components (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Input`, `Label`).
  - Unified themeable CSS Custom Properties (`--sec-*`) with built-in automatic dark mode (`prefers-color-scheme: dark` and `.dark` / `[data-theme="dark"]`).
  - 100% responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports with accessible modal dialogs and pure CSS trend chart bars.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Automated Host Setup in `security:install`**:
  - Automatically detects and injects the `HasSecurityRelations` trait and import into `app/Models/User.php`.
  - Automatically registers WAF middlewares (`BlockIpAddress` and `DetectSecurityThreats`) in `bootstrap/app.php` (Laravel 11 & 12) or `app/Http/Kernel.php` (Laravel 10).
  - Both injections are idempotent and preserve existing code formatting and PHPDoc tags.
  - Added `--without-user-trait` and `--without-middleware` flags to bypass automatic registration if needed.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- **Blade & TSX Starter Kit Tags**:
  - Added `--with-blade`, `--with-tsx`, and `--with-all` flags to `php artisan security:install` alongside interactive stack selection.
  - Added `starterkit-blade`, `starterkit-tsx`, `starterkit-all`, `security-dashboard-blade`, `security-dashboard-tsx`, and `security-dashboard-all` publication tags.
  - Enforced authentication and login requirement across all `/security` monitoring routes.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Refinements to post-2.0.0 headless architecture and route bindings.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **BREAKING — version corrected to a major.** Removing the CAPTCHA subsystem
  deletes public API (`CaptchaService`, `ValidCaptcha`, `CaptchaApiController`),
  routes, config keys, and `CAPTCHA_*` environment variables, so it is a
  breaking change. The same removal was briefly tagged `1.1.4`; `2.0.0` is the
  canonical release. See the `1.1.4` entry below for the full list of removals.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-10-03

### Removed

- **CAPTCHA subsystem removed.** The zero-dependency SVG CAPTCHA has been
  dropped to keep the package focused on WAF/threat protection. Deleted:
  `CaptchaService`, `ValidCaptcha` rule, `CaptchaApiController`, the
  `/api/security/captcha` endpoints, the `security.captcha` config block, and
  the `CAPTCHA_*` environment variables. Login brute-force protection is still
  provided by the multi-tier stepped login lockout.
## [1.1.3] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Log4Shell / JNDI detection** (`log4shell_jndi`): new zero-tolerance
  instant-block signature that detects `${jndi:...}` payloads in any request
  part (User-Agent, query string, body, headers), including the common
  obfuscations `${${lower:j}ndi:...}` and `${j${lower:n}di:...}` as well as
  URL-encoded forms such as `%24%7Bjndi%3A...`. Previously these payloads were
  neither detected nor logged, so a Log4Shell probe passed straight through.

### Changed

- README: the install command now uses the explicit stable constraint
  (`composer require robyajo/laravel-security-monitor:^1.1`) and warns against
  `@dev`, which forces the unreleased `dev-main` branch instead of a tagged
  release.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- README: installation guidance refresh (explicit stable constraint and the
  `@dev` warning).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Distribution: the Astro documentation site (`web/`) and the `documents/`
  folder are now excluded from the Composer/Packagist archive via
  `export-ignore` and `archive.exclude`. The previous `/DOCS` entry was
  case-sensitive and never matched the lowercase `documents/` folder, so the
  documentation was shipped to consumers by accident.

### Added

- Official documentation site (Astro + Starlight) maintained in a separate
  repository (`robyajo/web-laravel-security`). It is not part of the package
  distribution.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- **Livewire Starter Kit monitoring dashboard** (optional): publish six
  single-file Livewire pages (Overview, Security Logs, Blocked IPs, Server
  Audit, User Sessions, Unblock Appeals) with
  `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=starterkit-livewire`. The dashboard is
  disabled by default and served under `/security` behind the
  `web` + `auth` + `security.admin` middleware.
- **React (Inertia) Starter Kit monitoring dashboard** (optional): publish six
  server-rendered Inertia + React pages and shared components with
  `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=starterkit-react`. Backed by the new
  `Internal\SecurityMonitor\Http\Controllers\Dashboard\*` controllers, so no
  separate API token is required. Enable with `SECURITY_DASHBOARD_DRIVER=react`.
- `--with-dashboard` and `--with-react-dashboard` options on
  `php artisan security:install`.
- `documents/generate.php`: regenerates the `documents/index.html` portal
  (Tailwind CSS Play CDN + marked.js + Mermaid.js) from the markdown chapters.

### Changed

- The `dashboard` configuration block gained a `driver` option
  (`livewire` | `react`) and the new `SECURITY_DASHBOARD_DRIVER` environment
  variable. Both starter-kit dashboards share the same route prefix and
  authorization middleware.
- The documentation portal `documents/index.html` now uses the Tailwind CSS
  Play CDN instead of hand-written CSS, and its content is generated from the
  markdown chapters so it never drifts from `documents/`.

### Documentation

- Documented the Livewire and React dashboards in the README, the installation
  guide, and the frontend integration guides, including the new `.env`
  variables (`SECURITY_DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, `SECURITY_DASHBOARD_DRIVER`,
  `SECURITY_DASHBOARD_PREFIX`).

## [1.0.12] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **PHP 8.2 / 8.3 compatibility (critical)**: `UserLoginService` chained a
  method call directly off a `new` expression
  (`new $model()->newQuery()`). That syntax only parses from PHP 8.4, so on
  PHP 8.2/8.3 it raised a `ParseError` that failed every PHP 8.2/8.3 test-matrix
  job as well as the Pint job. It now uses `$model::query()`, which parses and
  formats identically on every supported PHP version.
- PHPStan: the `view()->exists('errors.blocked')` suppression now matches both
  the `true` and `false` evaluation, since the result depends on whether the
  host application has published the view.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- CI: `laravel/pint` and `larastan/larastan` are no longer `require-dev`
  dependencies. Pint requires PHP 8.3 and Larastan 3 requires Laravel 11+, which
  broke the PHP 8.2 / Laravel 10 matrix jobs. Both tools are now installed only
  in their dedicated CI jobs; run `composer dev:tools` locally to use them.
- PHPStan: replaced the environment-dependent `view()->exists()` ignore with an
  identifier-scoped ignore for `src/Http/Middleware/BlockIpAddress.php`.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- The application audit now reads `PUBLIC_API_KEY` and `TRUSTED_PROXIES` via
  `config('security.server_scan.*')` instead of calling `env()`
  inside a service, and the weak-key placeholder list no longer references an
  app-specific value.

### Fixed

- PHPStan: added `tests/*`-scoped ignores for Pest's magic `$this` /
  `TestCall` so IDE analysis of the test suite stays quiet, plus
  `reportUnmatchedIgnoredErrors: false`.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Static analysis setup: Larastan + PHPStan (`phpstan.neon.dist`,
  `phpstan-baseline.neon`), a `composer analyse` script, and a dedicated
  "Static Analysis" CI job.
- Regression tests covering the CAPTCHA endpoint, login recording, session
  logout, trusted IP storage, admin auto-unblock, and server scan with admins.

### Fixed

- `pushMiddleware()` was called on the `Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel`
  interface; middleware auto-registration now narrows to the concrete
  Foundation kernel before calling it.
- `CaptchaApiController` called the protected `CaptchaService::render()`; the
  public `/captcha` endpoint now uses `generate()` and verifies with the correct
  signature.
- Several listeners and services referenced a non-existent `User` class
  (`RecordUserLogin`, `ResetLoginAttempts`, `UserLoginService::trustIp()`,
  `UserLoginService::getRealtimeActiveUsers()`, and
  `ServerSecurityService::accountChecks()`), which silently disabled login
  recording, admin auto-unblock, and the 2FA server audit. All now resolve the
  configured user model dynamically.
- Added the missing `UserLoginService::logoutSession()` method used by the
  admin session endpoint.
- Corrected model relationship PHPDoc that referenced a non-existent
  `User` class, and used `getAuthIdentifier()` where the authenticated user
  contract is in play.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Publishable default 403 page `resources/views/errors/blocked.blade.php`
  (`vendor:publish --tag=security-views`), including a self-contained appeal
  form wired to the public unblock-ticket endpoint. Integrated into
  `security:install` with a new `--without-views` option.
- Laravel Pint configuration (`pint.json`), `composer format` / `composer lint`
  scripts, and a dedicated "Code Style" CI job.

### Changed

- Applied Laravel Pint code style across the source and test suites.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Presentation deck for the package under `paparan/`
  (`Laravel-Security-Monitor-Bulwark.pptx`, 20 slides) with a reproducible
  generator (`paparan/generate.php`). Excluded from the Composer distribution.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Exclude development-only assets (`.agents/`, `AGENTS.md`, `DOCS/`, `.github/`,
  `push.sh`) from the Composer distribution archive via `.gitattributes`
  `export-ignore` rules and the `archive.exclude` Composer setting, so
  `composer require` installs only the runtime package.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **Self-Hosted WAF & Threat Engine**:
  - Zero-tolerance instant block signatures (null byte, double extensions, path traversal, webshell probes, SSTI canary, polyglot uploads).
  - Multi-tier progressive threat scoring and auto-blocking with sliding time windows.
  - ReDoS-hardened regex patterns tuned against real-world incidents.
  - Reverse proxy support (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`).
- **Device-Level Quarantine & Scope**:
  - Granular blocking via `device_id` and `local_ip` (WebRTC / device fingerprint) to avoid punishing innocent users on shared NAT/router public IPs.
  - Block scopes: `ip` (entire router) vs `device` (specific client device).
- **Public Appeal & Ticket Submissions**:
  - Public headless REST API for unblock appeal ticket submission and verification.
  - Admin approval/rejection endpoints with automatic IP/device quarantine release.
- **Multi-Tier Stepped Login Protection**:
  - Stepped progressive lockouts (1m -> 5m -> 15m -> 1h -> 24h) preventing brute force and credential stuffing attacks.
  - Automatic failed login security event logging.
- **Zero-Dependency SVG CAPTCHA**:
  - Pure SVG vector-matrix challenge generator without GD or Imagick PHP extension requirements.
  - Cryptographically secure one-time stateless session tokens.
- **Server Integrity & Security Scanner**:
  - SHA-256 baseline creation and change verification.
  - Suspicious file & webshell scanner with safe admin deletion capabilities (traversal protected, vital files protected).
  - Server configuration audit (PHP version, debug mode, HTTPS cookies, Fortify 2FA).
- **Apache / Nginx Access Log Scanner**:
  - Streaming log parser to detect web attacks rejected before reaching Laravel.
  - Auto-import and zero-tolerance IP blocking from raw server logs.
- **Headless REST API Architecture**:
  - 100% decoupled from any specific frontend (React/Inertia/Blade/Livewire/Mobile).
  - Pure JSON endpoints for logs, blocked IPs, server scans, sessions, appeals, and captcha.
- **Enterprise Extensibility**:
  - Configurable user model (`config('security.user_model')`).
  - Configurable table names (`config('security.table_names.*')`).
  - `HasSecurityRelations` model trait for seamless user relationship bindings.
  - Laravel 10, 11, 12, and 13 compatibility.
